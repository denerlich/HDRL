Located in a confined space:

227 Liquid hydrogen will vaporize when exposed to ambient temperatures. It can also result in a heavier than air hydrogen cloud which can remain grounded. Failure of both walls of the

230 Leak of gaseous hydrogen into vacuum space will result in loss of vacuum. If pressure in the vacuum space rises sufficiently, it will activate the vacuum jacket pressure relief device and
release gaseous hydrogen to the environment.
