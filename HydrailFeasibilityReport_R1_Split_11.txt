and safety regulation issues that might emerge as the rail vehicles are designed and tested.



Significance: High - This risk has high significance because the key objective of the RER Program is
to introduce enhanced rail services on the GO network from 2025.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT



Mitigation: Metrolinx has already initiated the two HFC rail vehicle projects to mitigate this risk.
The HFC Bi-level EMU Concept Design Project has the objective of obtaining assurance that a
hybrid HFC system can be integrated into manufacturers existing EMU products. The HFC
Locomotive Concept Design Project has a similar objective and in addition will further progress
the systems integration development by proceeding with preliminary and detailed designs. It is
intended that this work is completed during the DBFOM procurement process so that bidders can
confidently plan for the production design and delivery of an HFC rail vehicle fleet within the
required RER timescales.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: The equivalent uncertainty in relation to the
Electrification Program relates to the timescales for completing the electrification infrastructure on
each GO corridor. If significant risks emerge in relation to corridor access, utilities diversions and
infrastructure modifications then this could also delay the achievement of the 2025 target.

4.12.2.3 Ability of Market to Provide Equipment and Design Services
There is a risk that hydrogen technology component vendors will have trouble scaling up to supply
the quantity of hydrogen infrastructure required by the Hydrail System.


Type: System Implementation



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - Even though individual vendors will be able to anticipate
that Hydrail is likely to procure a considerable volume of components they may not be able to
scale-up within the time required by RER. However, the whole hydrogen market is expanding in
parallel to the development of Hydrail so the risk is likely to be reduced.



Significance: Medium - A delay in the initial supply of key subsystem components would lead to a
delay in the commencement of services and slow down the incremental roll-out.



Mitigation: Proactive engagement with the market and provincial government to share the
ongoing development efforts. This will provide the hydrogen market with expectations, allowing
them to ramp up on their ability to deliver services.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: Electrification components are commoditized, and
since there are major players with electric locomotives and EMUs which are certified and exist in
the market, there are fewer uncertainties about the ability of the market to provide equipment and
services related to electrification.

4.12.2.4 Zoning and Planning
There might be objections raised by planning authorities and local communities to proposed
locations for the hydrogen production facilities.


Type: System Implementation



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - The likelihood of this risk occurring will depend on the
number of location options that are available and the success of the preceding public
communication strategy.



Significance: Medium - If there are delays in obtaining planning consents it would still be possible
to commence an initial Hydrail service through the purchase of hydrogen from existing industrial
suppliers.



Mitigation: Proactive engagement will be required with the municipal and provincial governments
to begin the planning work and obtain the zoning approvals required to set up the support
infrastructure for Hydrail.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: Electrification also has planning consent risks in
relation to the siting of substations.

Probability multiplied by Significance, based on High = 3, Medium = 2 and Low = 1.
The risks that have a score from 6 to 3 are of sufficient importance that their further investigation is

4.12.3 System Operational Risks
4.12.3.1 Forecasting the Future Price of Electricity
The actual average price differential between peak and off-peak rates might change from the forecast
rates provided by IESO.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - The electricity price forecasts used to calculate the
operating costs of Hydrail and Electrification have been provided by IESO and are based on the
2017 Long Term Energy Plan for Ontario



Significance: High – If the differencebetween the price of electricity paid by Hydrail and that for
Electrification narrows, this would weaken the economic case for Hydrail.



Mitigation: Engage with the provincial government to define, or pre-establish, the cost of
electricity relating to Hydrail.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: If the difference between the price of electricity paid
by Hydrail and that for Electrification increases, this would weaken the economic case for
Electrification.

4.12.3.2 Hydrail Operational Complexity
There are uncertainties about how HFC rail vehicles will be brought into service at the start of each
day and refuelled at the end of each day. There are also uncertainties around the type and frequency
of maintenance and renewal operations of the HFC components. These could have a significant
negative impact on the expected operational efficiency of the RER level of service.

Revision B

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT



Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - The probability of there being a significant negative
impact on the RER level of service from the adoption of HFC rail vehicles is not considered to be
high as Metrolinx currently has experience of managing a fleet of rail vehicles that requires
refuelling every day and that requires in-house maintenance activities to be carried out on the
vehicles’ propulsion systems.



Significance: High - This is a risk that is important because one of the key factors in determining
the viability of the Hydrail System is ensuring that it has a high level of operational efficiency



Mitigation: As part of the proposed “Recommended Next Steps” activities it is intended to
undertake further analysis of the operational capabilities of the Hydrail System and how they align
with the RER level of service.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: This is a much lower risk for the Electrification
Program as electric locomotives and EMUs have well proven operational and maintenance
requirements. In addition, the electric rail vehicles do not require to be refuelled.

4.12.3.3 Maintenance Staff Capabilities
It might be difficult to find sufficient numbers of staff with the specialized skills to maintain the Hydrail
System components, both on the locomotive and at offsite facilities.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - The likelihood of this risk occurring is low because there is
sufficient time to mitigate it and the demand for skilled hydrogen technicans will follow the
incremental introduction of an HFC fleet.



Significance: Medium - The impact of this risk will be on train service performance.



Mitigation: Engage with Ontario Ministry of Advanced Education and colleges in Ontario to ensure
that courses are available to train and certify existing and new staff as hydrogen technicians.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: Electrification will have a similar risk, since the new
electric locomotives and EMUs will require maintenance staff with new skills.

4.12.3.4 Hydrogen Production Failure
There is a risk of a shortage of supply of hydrogen due to a failure in the hydrogen production
subsystem or in the supply of electricity from the grid.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - The probability of this occurring is low as it is intended to store
up to three days supply of hydrogen at each hydrogen production facility. If this is not sufficient at
one particular location, contingency plans will be put in place to transport hydrogen from one of
the other production facilities.



Significance: Medium - This is not a significant risk as there will be built-in supply buffers in the
system to limit the severity of the impact.



Mitigation: As part of the proposed “Recommended Next Steps” activities it is intended to
produce a concept design of a generic hydrogen production facility. Within the design process
consideration will be given to mitigating this risk to an acceptable level.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: There is an equivalent risk in the Electrification
Program which relates to the reliability of supply of electricity. Redundancy has been built into the
connection of the OCS with the electricity grid to reduce this risk to an acceptable level.

4.12.3.5 Reliability of HFC Trains
There is a risk that the availability and performance of the HFC rail vehicles could be compromised
due to failures of components in the rail vehicle subsystem.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - A rail vehicle is a harsh environment particularly due to
climatic conditions and vibration. However, there is a considerable amount of experience of
operating HFC-powered buses where these conditions are probably worse than on a rail network.
In addition, the HFC subsystem will be designed so that the failure of one component will not have
a catastrophic impact on the operation of the rail vehicle. For example: the fuel cells will be
arranged in parallel stacks so that a failure of one unit will only result in a reduced amount of
output power and not the shut down of the complete fuel cell subsystem; even if the whole fuel
cell subsystem becomes unavailable there will be sufficient power in the battery system to enable
the rail vehicle to operate in degraded mode so that it can reach a place of safety; the battery
subsystem will also be designed so that a failure in one battery will only lead to a reduction in peak
power available to accelerate the train. It is likely that in this scenario that it will be possible to
continue to operate the train at close to normal performance. Furthermore, the planned train
consists will have the following redundancies: EMUs have multiple powered coaches so that the
train should be able to continue to operate even if the system on coach fails; adopting a two
locomotive consist for 12 carriages means that even if one locomotive fails it will still be possible
for the consist to continue working.



Significance: High - This is a risk of significant importance because it is fundamental to the
operational viability of the Hydrail System.



Mitigation: Gaining assurance about how the HFC rail vehicles will be able to continue to function
is one of the factors that will be investigated as part of the HFC Bi-level Concept Design project
and the HFC Locomotive project.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: There are similar risks with the electric locomotives
and EMUs. Even though there is a highlevel of reliability of the electrical components on an
electric locomotive or an EMU, there is a lower level of sytem redundancy than with a HFC rail
vehicle. In addition, any failure of the overhead contact wire on a section of corridor would lead to
significant operational disruption.

4.12.3.6 Impact on Passengers of a Train Accident
In the event of a train accident there is the potential that passengers could be hurt due to the ignition
or explosion of leaking hydrogen.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - The likelihood of this is low because: when hydrogen escapes
it disperses into the atmosphere very quickly; if a hydrogen leak does ignite then it burns with a
flame rather than explodes; the hydrogen will be stored on the rail vehicles in multiple tanks so
that it is unlikely that more than one tank would be damaged in an accident; the hydrogen will be
stored at 700 bar in the storage tanks which will encourage the hydrogen to escape quickly; in the
case of the HFC EMU the hydrogen tanks will be installed near the roof of the train where the gas

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

can quickly escape in the event of tank rupture; in the case of the HFC locomotive the tanks will be
isolated from the adjacent passenger coach by a fire proof barrier; the rail vehicle subsystem will
be designed to achieve a high level of crashworthiness; the rail vehicle subsystem will be
designed with automated shut-off systems that are designed to limit the amount of hydrogen that
can escape.


Significance: High - Any risk relating to safety will be treated with the highest level of significance
during the design of the HFC rail vehicles.



Mitigation: Gaining assurance about how the HFC subsystem will respond to an accident will be
part of the activities that we propose to undertake in Q1 and Q2 2018. It will also feature as part of
the HFC Bi-level Concept Design project and the HFC Locomotive project.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: In the event of an electric rail vehicle accident, there
could be a risk to passengers due to damaged overhead catenary infrastructure.

4.12.3.7 Implications to RER due to Hydrail
There is a risk that the operation of the Hydrail System might have a negative impact on the ability to
achieve the planned RER level of service.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - The feasibility study has not identified any area of the
operation of the Hydrail System that is likely to have a significant impact on the operation of RER.
The areas that this risk is most relevant to are: the performance and operation of a two-locomotive
consist; and the refuelling process.



Significance: Medium - The objective of the design of the Hydrail System is to match the RER level
of service in terms of terms of the RER train service plan. If this risk occurs it seems likely that the
reduction in level of service will be small. This risk also generates an opportunity whereby a small
reduction in train performance could lead to a significant reduction in Hydrail’s operating cost.



Mitigation: As part of the proposed “Recommended Next Steps” activities it is intended that the
Hydrail team will develop a more refined assessment of the train service capability of the HFC rail
vehicles and the operating processes of refuelling. We will also work with the RER Program team
to model operating cost savings that could be achieved from a range of reductions in train
performance and how this might impact the BCR for the Hydrail System.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: This exact risk is unlikely to be experienced with
electrification as electric locomotives and EMUs that are available for the major rail vehicle
manufacturers have performance characteristics that have been used in the simulation modelling
of RER. However, there might be the reverse risk if rail vehicles supplied have more performance
characteristics than required for RER (acceleration, top speed).

Table 4-56 collates the risks identified above and orders them using a rough risk ranking score of
Probability multiplied by Significance, based on High = 3, Medium = 2 and Low = 1.
The risks that have a score from 6 to 3 are of sufficient importance that their further investigation is
included within the scope of activities outlined in the “Recommended Next Steps” section.

4.12.4 Opportunities
4.12.4.1 Incremental Service Introduction
Electrification requires the infrastructure on each corridor to be completed before electrified services
can commence.
With the Hydrail System an electrified service can be introduced incrementally starting from a single
HFC rail vehicle on a corridor and then building up to a full service over a period of time.
The benefits of this approach are:


The possible earlier introduction of electrified services on any corridor than would be the case
with electrification which would improve the revenue benefits profile for RER;



Because there is less up-front fixed CAPEX for the Hydrail System compared to Electrification the
NPV for Hydrail is more aligned to the profile of the rolling stock delivery, whereas the NPV for
Electrification is more aligned to the up-front CAPEX. This should create a comparative advantage
for the Hydrail System in the business case analysis.



Most of the capital cost for Hydrail System is related to manufacture of the rolling stock and
therefore this is spread over the production period a longer period over which the capital cost of a
reduced dependency between the completion of RER infrastructure and the introduction of
electric rolling stock onto the GO network which could be beneficial in terms of public relations.

4.12.4.2 Advantage of Using Surplus Electricity
The Hydrail System will generally use surplus baseload electricity generated in the province to
produce hydrogen and will therefore pay for its power using rates that will not include the GA factor.
The OCS electrification option will largely use the higher day time rates of electricity that will also
include the GA.
Because the Hydrail System will use about 15 percent of the surplus power that is generated it
potentially could have an impact on the size of the GA that is added to the bills of all Ontario power
users.

4.12.4.3 Remove Diesel Locomotive Services from the Milton and
Richmond Hill Corridors
The rail infrastructure of the Milton and Richmond Hill corridors are not owned by Metrolinx. As a
result, it is not possible to install overhead electrification infrastructure on these corridors. However,
the Hydrail System option provides the ability to operate electric train services on these two corridors.
The benefits of this would be improved RER services being operated on these corridors and a
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for the GO network compared to electrification.
However, there would be additional capital and operating costs for the Hydrail System which would
need to be assessed against the revenue benefits of providing RER services on these corridors.

4.12.4.4 Hydrail as a Catalyst for the Implementation of a ‘Hydrogen Economy’
in Ontario
One of the constraints to the broader adoption of hydrogen as a replacement to fossil fuels as an
energy carrier is the current limited availability of hydrogen outside of industrial applications.
An investment in the infrastructure of hydrogen production and storage could be used as a lever by
the government of Ontario and/or the private sector to make hydrogen available to users outside of
Metrolinx.
There is the opportunity for Metrolinx to work with a broad cross-section of government departments
to develop a strategy similar to that recently published by the South Australia government203 for a
roadmap for a broader use of hydrogen across Ontario.
The potential benefits of this are:


Sharing of the costs of the fixed infrastructure assets



Reductions in the use of fossil fuels as energy sources



Development of businesses and jobs with a hydrogen technology focus



The development of Ontario as a global leader in the implementation of hydrogen technologies



Adoption of hydrogen as an energy storage material in combination with renewable energy
sources and the associated benefits in relation to the stabilization of the electricity grid in response
to variations in demand.

4.12.4.5 Shared Cost of Fixed Infrastructure
Hydrogen could also have other applications within Metrolinx that could then use the same hydrogen
production infrastructure.
Metrolinx is already considering the use of HFC-powered buses as replacements for its diesel bus
fleet.
There is the potential integrate this strategy with the development of the Hydrail System which could
lead to a shared hydrogen production, storage and refuelling infrastructure.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

In addition, there is the potential to use HFCs as main power sources or back-up power sources for
Metrolinx’s property portfolio. This could potentially lead to a reduction in operating costs or at least
improved energy security.

4.12.4.6 Capture of Energy through Regenerative Braking
All modern electric rail vehicles use their traction motors, working in reverse, as part of the vehicle’s
braking system. This means that the traction motor is working as a generator. Regenerative braking is
the ability to capture this electrical energy for a beneficial use.
With rail vehicles operating in an overhead catenary system this energy is fed back into the grid via
the vehicle’s pantograph. The amount of energy that is captured in this way is relatively small
compared to the total potential energy that would be available because there is no resulting benefit
to the operating of the vehicle and so vehicle’s electrical systems are not optimized for this purpose.
With the Hydrail System we believe that there is an opportunity to capture a significant additional
amount of the rail vehicle’s braking energy and to feed it into the batteries and utltracapacitors that
are part of the hybrid HFC subsystem.
We would do this by specifically focusing on the design of the rail vehicle’s electrical systems
(batteries, utltracapacitors and fuel cell) to optimize the amount of energy that can be cost effectively
captured (that is, within the constraints of space availability and equipment cost).
By doing this it should be possible to optimize the design of the subsystem to minimize the volume of
hydrogen that will be consumed on each trip. In this way, it should be possible to increase the overall
range of the Hydrail rail vehicles from what we can be maximized and the minimize the amount of
hydrogen that needs to be produced for the overall Hydrail System.
We plan to investigate this opportunity as part of the HFC Bi-Level EMU and HFC Locomotive projects
that will be undertaken during Q1 and Q2 2018.

RER Program Electrification

This section describes the scope of the currently proposed by the RER Program, including the
proposal for overhead electrification, and the issues that need to be resolved during preliminary
design and implementation.

5.1

Current RER Program

5.1.1

Scope

The Regional Transportation Plan for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), or The Big
Move, identifies the need for a significant increase in rail service across the GO network. Accordingly,
the RER program is being planned to provide more frequent, faster, and higher-capacity service204.
In January 2010, a study of the electrification of the GO rail system was initiated as a future alternative
to diesel trains currently in service. The objective of the Electrification Study was to provide
information so that a decision about how GO trains will be powered in the future – using electricity,
enhanced diesel technology, or other means – can be made, as this fleet propulsion upgrade has a
key role in delivering the Big Move205.
The IBC was published in 2015 and scoped the RER program by defining, analyzing, and reporting
the feasibility of various scenarios for GO RER service and infrastructure206.
In the RER business case, Scenario 1 (Do Minimum) is the base case that assumes a continuation of
today’s peak-focussed service patterns and diesel technology. All other scenarios are compared to it.
Scenario 2 (Two-Way All-Day) and Scenario 3 (10-Year Plan) consider more frequent all-day service,
looking at the costs and benefits of all-diesel and some limited electrification. Scenario 4 (Full Build) is
a maximum-build scenario, with frequent all-day service and overhead electrification on all corridors.
These four scenarios were studied so that different levels of service (LOSs) and infrastructure could be
assessed and compared to understand if and how they would achieve strategic objectives, how much
they would cost to build and operate, and how effective they would be at generating benefits, all
while considering deliverability constraints.
Scenario 5 (10-Year Plan Optimized) was then developed based on available funds and a 10-year
build period for delivery (Figure 5-1). This program includes electrification and frequent service on
most inner corridors207. For the purposes of this feasibility report, Hydrail is assessed against RER
Scenario 5.

To sum up, by 2024, the GO rail network is planned to:


Be expanded to enable electrified train service in core system areas at 15-minute frequencies or
better



Offer up to four times the current number of train trips during off-peak hours



Offer twice the current number of trips during peak hours throughout the network208

The scope of the RER project, as described in Scenario 5, involves electrification of the following GO
rail corridors:
1. Union Station Rail Corridor (Figure 5-2) – From Union Pearson (UP) Express Union Station to
Don Yard Layover
2. Lakeshore West Corridor – From just west of Bathurst Street (Mile 1.20) to Burlington
3. Kitchener Corridor – From UP Express Spur 8 (at Highway 427) to Bramalea
4. Barrie Corridor – From Parkdale Junction (off Kitchener Corridor) to Allandale GO Station
5. Stouffville Corridor – From Scarborough Junction (off Lakeshore East Corridor) to Lincolnville GO
6. Station
7. Lakeshore East Corridor – From Don Yard Layover to Oshawa GO Station209
Electrification of the system is one of the components of the RER program. It is being undertaken in
parallel with other projects to build all infrastructure needed to increase service210.
The infrastructure must accommodate the busiest hour of service during the peak-hour period, as well
as any track occupancy required by other rail operators (freight and intercity services). During the
peak hours, the number of trains may vary slightly; therefore, the worst-case scenario, or high peak
hour, was used to develop the infrastructure requirements for the 10-year plan (Scenario 5)211.

Figure 5-1 gives us an idea of the breadth of the civil works required to implement the electrification
infrastructure. Further to the overhead catenary system itself, there are signal immunization services to
be implemented, traction power stations to be built, modifications that need to be made to existing
stations, and changes required for existing bridges and layover facilities.

Procurement of Rolling Stock

Passenger rail rolling stock is traditionally built in fleets customized for a specific application. This is
because, although there are standard technical platforms, railways differ sufficiently in local technical
and environmental requirements. In comparison with automobile or even aircraft manufacture,
production runs are considered small218.
In Scenario 5, approximately 140 EMU cars would be required for the Lakeshore route, and
approximately 30 cars for each additional electrified route.
Procurement of a new rolling stock fleet is assumed to take 4 to 8 years, although it may be possible
to reduce this timeframe. The process entails:


Development of the customer requirements (car size, configuration of doors, seats)



Definition of detailed technical requirements



Definition of procurement contracting structure and finance



Option of long-term maintenance contract with extended warranty

Recommended Next Steps

This section recommends actions arising from the findings within this report, in relation to the further
development of the Hydrail System, in relation to the broader questions that inter-relate with the
Provincial government, and in relation to the development of the RER DBFOM.

6.1

Actions to Further Develop Hydrail

The proposed next steps for the development of the Hydrail System are focussed on the need to
maintain alignment between the development of Hydrail and the preparation activities for the RER
DBFOM procurement.
The primary objective of the proposed next steps is to enable the design of the whole Hydrail System
to be taken forward to conceptual design level so that by the time the DBFOM bidders start to
prepare their bids they will have access to high quality information about the design and operation of
the Hydrail System. This will enable the DBFOM bidders to more accurately assess the risks and
benefits of Hydrail in comparison with electrification than would otherwise be the case.
In particular, it is proposed that further work is undertaken in those areas of the Hydrail System where
the DBFOM bidders are likely to want a greater level of certainty than currently exists, at the
completion of the feasibility study. These are:


Refine the Hydrail System design in terms of system size, based on a more accurate representation
of the system configuration in the Operational Simulation model;



Comission concept designs for a HFC EMU, a HFC Locomotive and the hydrogen production,
hydrogen storage and hydrogen fuelling subsystems;



Identify preferred options for location of hydrogen production facilities for each corridor;



Confirm how the Hydrail System would function as an operational railway, particularly in areas
such as maintenance and refuelling;



Confirm the capital and operating cost estimates of the whole Hydrail System based on further
engagement with component vendors and a more formal approach to estimating infrastructure
and vehicle delivery costs;



Confirm how the Hydrail System could be implemented through its development and build
phases and particularly the transition plan of Hydrail into revenue service across the GO network;



Develop a Safety Case roadmap for Hydrail based on consultation with Transport Canada and
organizations responsible for maintaining and developing hydrogen related safety standards;



Build and operate a small-scale prototype of the Hydrail System including an HFC Locomotive.

6.1.1

System Size

The definition of the Hydrail System presented in this feasibility study is based on modelling work that
simulates how the whole system will operate every day. The Operational Simulation Model has been
specifically designed to simulate the performance of each of Hydrail’s subsystems and the design is
based on the following principles:


The fleet mix and train service pattern defined as Scenario 5 of the IBC for RER has been used to
calculate the peak and average power requirements for train trips on each GO corridor;

CPG-PGM-RPT-245
DATE: 02/02/2018

271

Revision B

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT



This data is used to size (power and physical dimensions) the fuel cell and batteries on the rail
vehicles;



This in turn determines how much hydrogen is required to operate the train for each trip, which
enables the total volume of hydrogen that is needed each day to be calculated;



From this the size of the electrolyzer components has been calculated, and



From this the amount of electrical power required each day for the Hydrail System has been
calculated.

At each step in this process, assumptions have been made about the:


RER GO network infrastructure and train services from 2025 onwards, and



Functional performance of each of the components in the Hydrail subsystems

It has been necessary to make these assumptions because:


The scope of RER has been developing in parallel to the Hydrail feasibility study, and



Our access to data on forecast component functional performance has been based on estimates
from a limited number of industry sources.

It is considered by the Hydrail team that many of the assumptions in the model are quite conservative
and therefore it is the team’s view that it would be beneficial to undertake further work to improve the
accuracy of the model’s outputs.
We intend to do this by:


Improving the sophistication of the model’s algorithms to more accurately simulate the power
requirements of the rail vehicles;



Cross-referencing the algorithms in the model with those being used by the rail vehicle
manufacturers who are participating in the HFC Bi-Level EMU Concept Design and HFC
Locomotive Concept Design projects, and



Obtaining access to actual component performance data from a range of manufacturers.

6.1.2

Subsystem Concept Designs

Even though the feasibility study concludes that there are no technology-related flaws with Hydrail
and that all elements required to assemble this system already exist elsewhere in similar applications,
the scale of Hydrail is bigger than anything that has currently been implemented. As a consequence,
there are technical areas of the Hydrail System definition where the levels of uncertainty need to be
reduced so that the risk profile of these areas is comparable to those of the overhead catenary system
solution.
By undertaking subsystem concept designs a much more precise sizing of all the components of the
overall Hydrail System will be achieved. For example, it would enable us to demonstrate how the
expected fuelling time can be achieved and to assess the way in which a Hydrail network could be
operated and maintained.
This reduces these risks so that the DBFOM bidders will be better able to assess the risks and benefits
of Hydrail in comparison with electrification.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

Therefore, we intend to initiate engineering concept design studies of:
1. A HFC bi-Level EMU. A procurement process is already underway to commission a number of rail
vehicle manufacturers to produce concept designs that integrates a hybrid fuel cell system into
their existing bi-level EMU models. The output of this work will provide valuable information on
whether the performance of the HFC bi-level EMU will meet the RER requirements, the range of
the vehicle between refueling, the likely unit price of the vehicle and the phases in the
development of production models;
2. A HFC Locomotive. A procurement process has started to commission a number of rail vehicle
manufacturers to produce concept designs that integrates a hybrid fuel cell system into their
existing electric locomotive models. The output of this work will provide the same range of useful
information as for the HFC bi-level EMU;
3. A hydrogen production and storage facility of a size that would be needed for one of the GO
corridors. This will provide us with equipment layout information and component sizing and an
understanding of how the facility will be connected to the electricity grid;
4. A hydrogen refuelling and dispensing facility of a size that would be needed to refuel an HFC EMU
fleet and an HFC locomotive fleet. This will also provide us with equipment layout information and
component sizing and an understanding of how the facility will operate in its interface with the rail
vehicles. In particular, it would be designed to achieve the objective of a refuelling time that meets
the fleet operation and maintenance expectations of Metrolinx.
We intend to undertake this work by assembling a team of consultants, government agencies and
universities that we have already engaged with during the feasibility study who have specialist
knowledge and capabilities in these areas. This work wouldbe project managed by the existing
Metrolinx Hydrail team.

6.1.3

Hydrogen Production Location Identification

One of the key variables in the configuration of the Hydrail System are the proposed locations for the
hydrogen production facilities. The factors that will need to be considered in deciding on these
locations include:


The area required for the facility (this has been covered by the work described above)



The locations for rail vehicle stabling facilities in the RER program



Land that is currently available within Metrolinx’s ownership that could be suitable for such a
facility



Land that is outside Metrolinx’s ownership but is close to the proposed rail vehicle stabling
facilities



Land that is suitable for such a facility that is located at some distance from the rail network and
would be suitable to enable transportation of hydrogen by truck or pipeline to the rail network



The potential to expand the facility for hydrogen production use beyond that required for
Metrolinx’s Hydrail



The planning and permitting constraints that would relate to any identified land



The cost of purchase and/or remediation of any identified land

We intend to undertake work that will identify a range of options for the hydrogen production
locations to enable the Hydrail system to function in both its Scenario 5 and full network

configurations. We will then assess these options using the criteria of capital cost, operating cost and
planning feasibility and determine the optimized solution.
The team undertaking this work will include Metrolinx property staff and RER fleet maintenance
planning staff.

6.1.4

Operational Functionality

Although the feasibility study has not identified any flaws in how GO would operate using a Hydrail
System, there are operational processes that need to be considered in more detail to give DBFOM
bidders sufficient assurance that it is feasible to operate. These processes include:


Cyclical maintenance and renewal regimes for the rail vehicle subsystem



Refuelling the trains as part of the end of day processes



Management of degraded rail vehicle operability due to failure of a component within the hybrid
HFC subsystem



Response to degraded rail services that prevents access to a refuelling facility



Start of day and end of day routines for the rail vehicle subsystem



Operational and maintenance routines for the hydrogen production, storage and transportation
subsystems

We intend to create system diagrams for each of these processes so that it is clear how a Hydrail
System would integrate with the railway operational processes that DBFOM bidders will be familiar
with from operating railway systems based on overhead catenary system of electrification.

6.1.5

Cost Estimates

The feasibility study has identified all the key capital and operating cost components in the Hydrail
System. The cost values that have been used in the Operational Simulation Model have been
obtained for information provided by discussions with industry sources and have been validated
against published data.
As a result of the further system sizing work, concept design work and hydrogen production facility
location work that we have identified above it will be possible to undertake a more formal cost
estimating exercise of the capital and operating costs. This will also be accompanied by a quantified
risk assessment to more accurately evaluate the forecast cost distribution for different risk parameters.
As part of this process there will be a further evaluation of the forecast prices of electricity that it is
appropriate to use in the calculation of the Hydrail System’s operating cost.

6.1.6

Implementation Plan

Section 4.11 of this report provides an initial view of how the Hydrail System could transition into initial
operation. As stated in that section there are many interdependencies of a physical and a timing
nature between the RER program’s infrastructure upgrades and the Hydrail System.
We intend to work with the RER planning team so that we can create a more detailed transition
scenario that integrates with the proposed sequence of infrastructure work and identifies:


Which corridor would be best suited for the initial testing of the HFC rail vehicles



Which corridor would be best suited for the initial revenue service

The preferred sequence of corridors that would then introduce the service and how this would
relate to the incremental build of the hydrogen production, storage and dispensing facilities

6.1.7

Safety Case Roadmap

Section 4.6 of this report provides an overview of the existing codes and standards that apply to
hydrogen systems and identifies the need to undertake work that will:


Assess the risks relating to the operation of the Hydrail System



The development of further codes and standards for the operation of the Hydrail System
particularly in relation to the refuelling subsystem and the rail vehicle subsystem

During the feasibility study the Hydrail team has commenced engagement with Transport Canada and
held initial discussions with them about evaluating the safety risk of the Hydrail System concept.
In taking forward this area of work the Hydrail team intends to form a working committee that will
include Transport Canada, TSSA, CSA, the Canadian Hydrogen Installation Code Standards
Committee and equivalents in the United States. The objective of this group will be to develop a
pathway for the development of a full suite of codes and standards that will apply to Hydrail.

6.1.8

Prototype Hydrail System

Irrespective of how much systems modelling and concept design work is undertaken the complete
viability of the Hydrail System can only be demonstrated by designing, building and operating an
example of the complete end to end system.
At the conclusion of the above activities Metrolinx intends to:


Commission the building of a single prototype HFC Locomotive that can enter revenue service



Commission the development and prototyping of the refueling and hydrogen production subsystems that can work with the prototype HFC Locomotive.

Operating this prototype Hydrail System over an extended period will enable Metrolinx to learn
valuable lessons concerning Hydrail System’s operations, performance and reliability which can then
be fed back into the design and implementation planning of a full Hydrail System.

6.2

Actions to Align the Hydrail System with Provincial
Government Policy

6.2.1

Electricity Price Policy

As outlined in Section 4.4, the calculation of the net present value of the operating cost of the Hydrail
System is sensitive to the forecast hourly prices of electricity from 2025 onwards. For the Hydrail
System to retain its BCR equivalence to the conventional overhead electrification system, the
differential between the average off-peak price of electricity to the average peak price of electricity
needs to remain at the level used in this analysis (which is: off-peak = 0.4 x peak).
Therefore, any narrowing of the differential between the price of electricity paid by Hydrail and that
for conventional electrification would weaken the economic case for Hydrail. Due to the many
variables that could influence the price of off-peak electricity in the future this is considered to be a
highly significant risk (as described in 4.12.3.1).
As a consequence, this risk needs to be mitigated to avoid DBFOM bidders including a substantial
risk premium into their operating cost calculations for the Hydrail System. A recommended next step
is therefore for Metrolinx to engage with the provincial government to determine if it is possible to
define, or pre-establish, the cost of electricity relating to the Hydrail System.

6.2.2

Hydrogen Economy

As outlined in Section 4.9.1, there are opportunities for the Hydrail System to be a catalyst for the
broader adoption of hydrogen in the Ontario economy. As described in Section 4.12.4.4, the benefits
of this Hydrogen Economy concept could be:


Sharing of the costs of implementing the fixed infrastructure assets



Reductions in the use of fossil fuels as energy sources



Development of businesses and jobs with a hydrogen technology focus



The development of Ontario as a global leader in the implementation of hydrogen technologies



Adoption of hydrogen as an energy storage material in combination with renewable energy
sources and the associated benefits in relation to the stabilisation of the electricity grid in response
to variations in demand.

Taking forward the development of those opportunities, which are beyond Metrolinx’s transportation
mandate, will require consideration and guidance from the provincial government, and potentially
part of a broader “hydrogen roadmap”. A recommended next step is therefore to work with the
provincial government to develop a cross-government business case for an Ontario Hydrogen
Economy.

Actions to Integrate the Hydrail System into the

As stated at the start of Section 6.1 one of the objectives of the “Recommended Next Steps” is to
provide high quality information on the Hydrail System to the DBFOM bidders.
As such the Hydrail team will work with the Metrolinx team that is managing the DBFOM procurement
process over the course of 2018 to ensure that the activities to further develop the Hydrail System
concept are aligned with the DBFOM’s timescales and objectives.
